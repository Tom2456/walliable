- Only works for Pop_OS! and Feh for now, and wallpapers are limited to jpg.
- Very configurable thanks to the settings.h file.
# Installation
1. Clone the repo
1. Create a build directory
1. Set the correct wallpaper folder path in the settings.h file
1. Rename any pictures in the folder like so: 0.jpg, 1.jpg, 2.jpg... then set the correct wallpaper amount in the settings file
1. Run ``make`` and ``make install``
> After any changes in the settings file don't forget to rebuild
